#PBH Detection Framework (CIEL/0)

##This repository contains tools for processing Planck Satellite FITS files to verify the existence of a Primordial Black Hole (PBH) or Planet X within the Solar System.

 The analysis is based on the CIEL/0 unified framework developed by Adrian Lipa, which integrates gravitational dynamics, metatime theory, and CMB anomalies.
🔭 Project Overview
The objective is to analyze specific regions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for point-source anomalies or gravitational lensing signatures. Based on 100,000-year orbital simulations (using the REBOUND integrator), the predicted coordinates for the PBH are:
 * RA: 07^{h} 10^{m} 18.395^{s}
 * Dec: -25^{\circ} 54' 27.284''
 * Constellation: Puppis
📂 Repository Structure
 * data/: Directory for .fits files (Planck 100, 143, and 217 GHz, Releases 1–3).
 * src/: Python scripts for image processing and statistical analysis.
 * docs/: PDF documentation including Neutrinotime and CMB Dynamics papers.
 * cielnofft.txt: Implementation of the CIEL/0 Theory of Everything framework.
🛠 Features
 * Multi-Rel Cross-Correlation: Compares Rel1 vs Rel3 to detect temporal changes or moving sources.
 * Background Subtraction: Uses sigma_clipped_stats to remove the CMB "noise" and isolate anomalies.
 * WCS Mapping: Translates celestial coordinates (RA/Dec) directly to pixel coordinates in Planck maps.
 * Automated Source Detection: Implements DAOStarFinder to flag objects exceeding the 5\sigma threshold.
🚀 Quick Start
1. Requirements
pip install numpy astropy matplotlib photutils

2. Run Analysis
Place your FITS files in the root directory and execute:
import src.pbh_analyzer as pbh
pbh.run_full_scan(target_ra=107.5766, target_dec=-25.9075)

📜 Scientific Background
The scripts included here utilize the LPEG Model (Lipa-Penrose-Ebrahimi-Greene). This model suggests that the cosmological constant (\Lambda) is dynamic and can be influenced by local informational coherence. The search for the PBH is a critical test of this framework.
